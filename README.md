### Project Description  
This project uses two OLED displays and a TTP223 touch sensor to create an interactive animated face.  
It features smooth eye movement, random expressions, and blinking, with a pulsing heart animation when touched.  
A double-tap gesture displays a random number on both screens, making it both engaging and playful.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Life is full of hard decisions. Like whether to eat one more dosa or not.  
Sadly, no OLED-faced friend exists to help you decide ‚Äî until now.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We built a touch-sensitive, animated face that blinks and pulses like it has emotions.  
Double-tap it, and it shows either a "1" or "2" to help you decide.  
Absolutely unnecessary. Gloriously useless.
